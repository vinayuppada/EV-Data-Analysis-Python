# Electric Vehicle Data Analysis using Python  
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes electric vehicle (EV) data to uncover meaningful insights, validate hypotheses, and provide actionable recommendations. Using Python and data analysis techniques, we explore key aspects such as range, energy consumption, battery capacity, and price to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

### 🚀 **Key Features & Analysis**
✔ **Budget-based EV Selection**: Filtering EVs within a customer’s budget and preferred range  
✔ **Outlier Detection**: Identifying unusually high or low energy consumption  
✔ **Battery vs. Range Analysis**: Exploring relationships between battery capacity and driving range  
✔ **EV Recommendation System**: Suggesting top EVs based on user input  
✔ **Hypothesis Testing**: Statistical comparison between Tesla and Audi engine power  

## 📊 **Dataset Overview**
The dataset contains various EV attributes, including:
- **Car Specifications**: Make, model, power, torque, battery capacity, weight, seating capacity  
- **Performance Metrics**: Range, acceleration, energy consumption, charging power  
- **Price Details**: Minimum price (in PLN)  
- **Physical Dimensions**: Length, width, height, wheelbase, tire size  

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** 📊 (Data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** 📈 (Data visualization)
- **SciPy (Hypothesis Testing)** 🔬
- **OOP in Python** 🔄 (Recommendation System)

## 📌 **Tasks Breakdown**
✅ **Task 1**: Filtering EVs based on budget (350,000 PLN) and minimum range (400 km)  
✅ **Task 2**: Detecting outliers in energy consumption  
✅ **Task 3**: Visualizing the relationship between battery capacity and range  
✅ **Task 4**: Implementing an **EV Recommendation System** in Python
